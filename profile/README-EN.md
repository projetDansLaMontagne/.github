# projetDansLaMontagne (Project in the mountains) ([FR](./README.MD))
> Tutored third year project of BUT Informatique.

## The Team

We are a team of five students at [IUT de Bayonne](https://www.iutbayonne.univ-pau.fr/presentation.html) in the third (and final) year of [BUT informatique](https://www.iutbayonne.univ-pau.fr/but/informatique).

## The Project

The [refuge de Pineta](https://www.valpineta.eu/en/el-refugio/) and its hikers need a mobile application to have access to the tracks and maps and to place points of interest (beautiful view, tree blocking the path, ...) during a walk. Since it does not often have a connection, the application must be able to work offline.

## Technologies
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the application.

  This allows us to have a single code for one app on both iOS and Android.
- Wordpress API/Plugin for communication with comics.
- Binary files compiled using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

  These files allow us to make comparisons between GPX files, switching from GPX to JSON, etc... See [the response](https://github.com/projetDansLaMontagne/gpx-coords-tools) for more information.
